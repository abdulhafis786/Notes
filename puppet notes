I hope for this error we have to generate a new cert

puppet cert generate <puppet master's certname> --dns_alt_names=<comma-separated list of DNS names>

Additional note: Before running puppet cert generate, remove the .pem files for the puppet master in /var/lib/puppet/ssl/private_keys, /var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca/signed/ and /var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs. Generating a new certificate is not killing connectivity to existing clients, as they verify the certificate of the puppetmaster using the CA's certificate, which they downloaded at first connect

Issue seems to be due to the puppet cert DNS name mismatch. I gave the below in master puppet.conf and it worked 

dns_alt_names=puppet.test.org

*******************************************************************

puppet resource user -- this is a resource command which will list the format in which the user has to be declared in puppet.

facter operatingsystem --- get the facter value from the server

puppet apply --noop /vagrant/manifests/tmp-testfile.pp -- to check what would change without actually applying the change.

file { '/etc/hosts':
audit => 'all',
}

here audit resource type is used to know what changes have been made on a particular file. Usually 'all' is used.

puppet module list --- to list the modules present in the puppet server

puppet module install puppetlabs-apache -- to download the module from the puppet forge. Always have to provide the exact name for the module.

puppet module generate do-wordpress --skip-interview --- this is to generate a new module. --skip-interview is used to skip the interactive questions that are given while creating a module.

puppet module generate apache-test --- to generate a new module but in some version of puppet it does not create a new metadata.json which is important. so in that case we have to build the module 

puppet module build apache-test -- this will build the module and createa metadata.json file as well,

puppet module install abdulhafis786-lamp.1.0.1-tar-gz --ignore-depedencies ---- to install a module locally. this is done to install it as a local module

puppet module uninstall abdulhafis786-lamp -- to uninstall a module

hiera -c hiera.yaml sshservicename osfamily=RedHat -- to test if the defined value in hiera.yaml amd the respective Os family yaml are correct.

puppet apply packagetag.pp --skip_tags service -- to skip a tag value. Tags are nothing but puppet generated service values that could be used to apply only a part of code.

puppet apply packagetag.pp --tags service -- this will apply only the service resource in the pp file.



----------------------------------------------------

To connect the agent on a new puppet master

on the master/ca server you need to run:

puppet cert clean client-certname

on the client rm -rf /var/lib/puppet/ssl

then on the client:

puppet agent --server servername --waitforcert 60

if you dont have autosign enabled then on the server run puppet cert sign certname..Then from the agent run puppet agent -t

To test if the agent os able to connect with the master telnet <puppet master IP> 8140
